# Scalekit Authentication Helper

Welcome to the Scalekit Authentication plugin! I'll help you implement Scalekit authentication in your application.

## Choose Your Implementation Path

Ask yourself these questions:

**Are you building a new application that needs authentication?**
→ Use **Full-Stack Authentication** path

**Do you have existing authentication but need to add Enterprise SSO (SAML/OIDC)?**
→ Use **Modular SSO** path

**Are you building an MCP server that needs OAuth 2.1?**
→ Use **MCP Server Authentication** path

## What would you like to do?

1. **Implement Full-Stack Authentication**
   - Complete auth system for web apps
   - Handles login, signup, logout, sessions
   - Supports social login + enterprise SSO
   - Frameworks: Express, Next.js, FastAPI

2. **Add Modular SSO to Existing Auth**
   - Keep your existing authentication
   - Add SAML/OIDC for enterprise customers
   - No user migration needed
   - Frameworks: Express, Next.js

3. **Secure MCP Server with OAuth 2.1**
   - OAuth 2.1 compliance for MCP protocol
   - Scalekit-managed or custom auth
   - Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code

4. **Validate Environment Setup**
   - Check Scalekit credentials
   - Test API connectivity
   - Verify configuration

Please tell me which path you'd like to take, or ask me any questions about Scalekit authentication!
