# Initialize Scalekit Authentication Project

I'll help you set up a new project with Scalekit authentication.

## Step 1: Gather Information

First, let's understand your project:

1. **What framework are you using?**
   - Node.js + Express
   - Next.js (App Router)
   - Python + FastAPI
   - Other (tell me which one)

2. **What authentication path do you need?**
   - Full-Stack Authentication (complete auth system)
   - Modular SSO (add SSO to existing auth)
   - MCP Server Authentication (OAuth 2.1 for MCP)

3. **Do you have Scalekit credentials?**
   - If yes: I'll help you set up environment variables
   - If no: I'll guide you to create a Scalekit account

## Step 2: Setup Process

Once you answer the questions above, I will:

1. Create the necessary environment configuration (.env file)
2. Guide you through installing the Scalekit SDK
3. Provide complete, working code for your framework
4. Set up validation scripts to test your configuration
5. Give you a production deployment checklist

## Step 3: Validation

After setup, we'll run validation scripts to ensure everything works:
- Environment variables configured correctly
- Scalekit API connectivity verified
- Authentication flow tested

Please answer the questions in Step 1, and I'll get started with your setup!
