# Validate Scalekit Configuration

I'll help you validate your Scalekit setup by running the validation scripts.

## Validation Steps

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Verify SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL is set
   - Verify SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID is set
   - Verify SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET is set
   - Check callback URLs are configured

2. **Test Scalekit API Connectivity**
   - Attempt connection to Scalekit API
   - Verify credentials are valid
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Test Authentication Flow** (optional)
   - Interactive OAuth flow test
   - Verify token exchange works
   - Test callback handling

## Running Validation Scripts

The Scalekit authentication plugin includes Python validation scripts. Let me check if they're available and run them for you.

Do you have:
- Python 3.7+ installed?
- Required packages (anthropic, python-dotenv)?
- A .env file with Scalekit credentials?

Let me know and I'll run the appropriate validation scripts or help you set them up!
